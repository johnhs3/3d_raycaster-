TODO:
- Version 2:
  Screen resize issues, input lag on controls, ACTUAL collisions with walls (!), TEXTURES !!!, conditional open doors (press e), floor textures.
- Make separate header files for levels' floors, wall textures, etc. System for adding them in game.
- Make some custom textures
- While we're here, is there a good tool to too turn bitmap images of a fixex size into boolean arrays?
- PORT ENGINE TO FREEGLUT!!! (This involves actually learning some FreeGlut from the Pentamollis project; buying the book on computer graphics

Intermediate goal:
- Eliminate second screen / Top-down. Resize window accordingly! (Perhaps make some function that enables it as a debug feature???


LONG-TERM PROJECTS:
- Optimize game and convert to C that is usable in a Gameboy Advance!
- Add a title screen, menu, HUD. All things that make a game a staple.
- Add support for RGB textures, converted from bitmap.
